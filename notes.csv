"Efficient, Secure, and Transparent Verification","<i>Previously, commit signatures were verified on demand, via a process that was not performant and had risks of previously verified signatures becoming “unverified” due to various reasons like service outages or key rotations.

Persistent commit signature verification solves these issues by validating signatures at the time of the commit and storing the verification details permanently. This also brings consistency to the commit history as git commits are immutable and they do not natively support key rotation.

Managing commit signatures can be a challenge, but persistent records ensures that verified commits remain verified over time, even if signing keys are rotated, revoked, or contributors leave the organization.</i>"
